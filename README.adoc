= Asciidoctor reveal.js template 
:author: @martsec

After building 12 slide decks of too many slides each one, 
I wanted to share what I've learnt and loved of using asciidoctor 
to build them. 

In the https://asciidoc-slides.8vi.cat[🖥️ demo 💻] you'll find tips, tricks and a slide deck *with a logo* that you can reuse!

I assume you are a bit familiar with asciidoctor or markdown, 
and if not, that you are not afraid of reading documentation
and testing things out. 

== 👩‍💻 Why writing your presentations as code

* Versioning in visual editors sucks.
* You are used to version your code already.
* You prefer to not spend ages animating and aligning each element.
* Your animated slides now don't depend of people buying licenses to Microsoft.

This might not be for you if you are not comfortable with a plain text editor and prefer the nicer(?) user interface of LibreOffice or Microsoft Office.

== 🔨 Installing

. Clone this git repository
. Install asiidoctor reveal-js https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/releases/tag/v5.0.0-rc.1[v5.0.0-rc.1]

TIP: You can download the executable directly from the "Assets" section

== ✍🏾 Writing slides

You are going to mostly write text with a bit of flavored extras. 
It helps focusing on what you want to tell instead of on formatting. 

Best practices:

* Split your slides in different sections and put those in separated files.
* Have your code in a separate file and use includes.
* Use images and diagrams.
* Keep the text short.
* Use lists and icons.
* Upload your "code" to a git service (e.g. gitlab, github) as you do with normal code.

== 🎁🌐 Compiling to HTML page

`./asciidoctor-revealjs presentation.adoc`

Then, open it with your browser and that's it! You can also serve this in a github page for everyone to enjoy.


== 🖨️ Obtaining a PDF and printing

1. Compile to HTML
2. Use Microsoft edge to go to the print version `file:///.../s1.html?print-pdf`. It's the browser that's respecting more the format. Chrome should also be enough but I've been having some challenges.
3. Print using "save as PDF". File will be big since it will include all the images in their high definition magnificency. 
4. Upload the file to https://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf[small PDF] or a similar service to compress it down. The free version is enough

For more information check https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/[Reveal.js PDF export] documentation.


== ❌ Not supported

Asciidoctor reveal.js does not support compiling plantUML diagrams, like we are used to with the normal version. If you know how to do it, please contribute!
